### Tutorial

[Here is a great tutorial](https://faculty.cascadia.edu/mpanitz/Courses/BIT142/Lessons/Lesson_110_Git/Elegit/Install_Basics.html) for getting started with Elegit. Thanks to Mike Panitz for this!

### Running the source code in IntelliJ:
1. Open [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
2. Visit the File, Other Settings, Default Settings menu. In the dialog that pops up, go to Build, Execution, and Deployment,
then Build Tools, Maven, Importing. Check the box about 2/3 of the way down the screen by "Automatically Download",
next to Documentation.
2. Check out the repository using the "Check out from Version Control option" and paste the GitHub repository URL in.
3. It will ask you to open `pom.xml`. Choose yes.
4. Let it load.
5. It will ask at some point if you want to auto import settings from Maven; say yes.
4. In the *Project Structure* menu, under *Project*, make sure the Project SDK is *at least* Java Version 8 Update 60.
5. Run the `main` method of the `Main` class.
